The code in this repo allows you to create fake data for software testing or other development and testing where you need a data set.

See the companion tutorial that explains the code at https://www.analystfactory.com

There are two files available with the same code. One .py file that you can run from your code editor and one .ipynb that you can run from a Jupyter style notebook.
